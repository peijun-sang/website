#   description: The radioactive element astatine exists only in trace amounts in nature.
#     Its properties can therefore only be explored by study of the minute quantities
#     of artificially produced isotopes or by performing theoretical calculations. One
#     of the most important properties influencing the chemical behaviour is the energy
#     required to remove one electron from the valence shell, referred to as the ionization
#     potential.
